                    <h1>Objective &amp; Subjective Assessment</h1>
                </div>

                <p>There are two different types of assessment:  Objective and Subjective.</p>
                
                <p>Objective assessments are those for which an exact mark can be awarded according to a precise rule. 
                The competitor is either awarded the mark or is not. Thus the award for an objective Aspect is either 
                a mark as specified within the Aspect definition or zero. In some cases it is possible to vary the mark 
                award on an exact formula - for example where a tolerance is given it would be acceptable to award part 
                marks at one level of achieved tolerance and higher marks for reaching a better tolerance level. This 
                information can be applied to an 'Aspect' by using additional lines (Add) of marking instructions.</p>

                <p>Subjective assessments are those where the mark awarded depends on the personal opinion of a group 
                of judges. This type of marking usually involves an assessment of personal skill or creative ability. 
                It is a form of Aesthetic assessment. The judges, individually and without discussion with their 
                colleagues, decide the scores they will award for each Aspect of Criterion (on a scale of 1 to 10). 
                The marking group then get together as a team and every judge in the group displays, at a suitable 
                signal, a score card according to his/her opinion of the quality of the item. The team must mark ALL 
                competitors for the aspects they are assessing.</p>
